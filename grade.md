Grade: 48/60
Comments: Commenting: Excellent, but some of your design choices are bad.  You did not need the while loop to open the files for instance.

File Input: A little over-engineered.  But it works.

REPORTS:  All done within one pass of the data.  Excellent attempt.  

File Output: You needed to check that the new files did not already exist to get highest marks here.  

Overall, an excellent attempt.








Rubric:
Task 2a - Internal Documentation: Outstanding Pass (8 Points) - All of the code has associated comments that effectively describe the code block. An attempt to justify construct choices has been made but one or two are poorly made choices and/or not effectively justified.

Task 2b - File Input: Exceptional Pass and Pass+ (5 Points) - The files have been successfully opened and data loaded, the filenames are allowed to be entered by the user and there are checks that the files exist before they are opened.

Task 2c - Shelf Stocking Report: Outstanding Pass (8 Points) - The code satisfies all of the functional requirements of the processing of the data and the two displayed reports are output sequentially as required. The design and code are efficient and effective; it passes over the data only once. There is no development of functions.

Task 2c - Stock Re-ordering Report: Outstanding Pass (16 Points) - The code satisfies all of the functional requirements of the processing of the data and the two displayed reports are output sequentially as required. The design and code are efficient and effective; it passes over the data only once. There is no development of functions.

Task 2d - File Output: Excellent pass (11 Points) - The code satisfies all of the functional requirements of the file output and is very efficient and effective. There has been no development of functions though.
